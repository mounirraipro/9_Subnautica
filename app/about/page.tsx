                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Subnautica was born from a simple idea: what if playing Subnautica could be even simpler and more accessible?. The result is a game
                    that&apos;s instantly intuitive yet endlessly engaging — an experience unlike any other on the web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We launched Subnautica with a clear vision — to create a free, accessible, and
                    beautifully designed game that anyone can enjoy. Whether you&apos;re taking a break,
                    unwinding after work, or looking for something your whole family can enjoy,
                    Subnautica has something for you.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that games are more than entertainment — they&apos;re tools for building
                    skills, improving focus, and finding moments of calm in a busy world. Our mission
                    is to make high-quality game experiences freely available to everyone, everywhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every level in Subnautica is handcrafted with care. We obsess over the details
                    so you can simply enjoy the game.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Quality Over Quantity:</strong> We&apos;d rather have fewer beautifully crafted
                    levels than hundreds of mediocre ones. Every piece of content is tested and refined before release.
